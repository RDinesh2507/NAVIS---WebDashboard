NavisWebhost Satellite Data Dashboard

NavisWebhost Dashboard is a real-time web interface to monitor satellite telemetry, environmental conditions, and system health. Built with Flask and Tailwind CSS, it displays live data for temperature, pressure, altitude, motion, orientation, air quality, toxic gas levels, UV detection, battery status, and satellite connectivity.

It also includes a webcam feed placeholder for live satellite visuals, with future support for ML-based object detection. The dashboard features a responsive, dark-themed design with real-time IST date and time updates.
